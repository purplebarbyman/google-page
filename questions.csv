Option C is the best choice as it is a practical technique to manage the coach's own state to create a better coaching presence. Option A ignores the coach's state, potentially leading to a poor session. Option B may be unnecessary and inconvenient for the client. Option D centers the coach's feelings rather than creating a calm space for the client.",2
1002,Coaching Structure,1.1.2,Application,"Prior to a follow-up session with a client focused on weight management, what is the MOST important document for the coach to review?",The client's initial intake form from three months ago.,The client's food and activity log from the previous week.,A recent article on new weight loss strategies.,The coaching agreement signed at the first session.,B,"Competency 1.1.2 is ""Review available client materials."" For a follow-up session, the most relevant and immediate material is the client's self-monitoring data from between sessions (B), as this will be the focus of the conversation. While A and D are important, they are less critical for this specific session. C represents external information, not client-specific material.",2

I'll send you a list of foods to eat and avoid.""",B,"This question tests the coach's ability to explain the coaching process and clarify roles (JTA T-1). Option B correctly defines the coach's non-directive, facilitative role and empowers the client as the expert in their own life, which is a core tenet of the coaching agreement. Options A and D are prescriptive and fall outside the coaching scope of practice. Option C redirects the client's agenda.",2
1005,Coaching Structure,1.3.1,Application,What is the primary purpose of having a client assess their current state of health and wellbeing in an early coaching session?,For the coach to identify the client's most significant health risks and set priorities.,To establish a baseline from which the coach can measure the client's progress over time.,To help the client generate awareness and identify potential gaps between their current reality and their desired future.,To gather data that the coach can share with the client's primary care physician.,C,"Competency 1.3.1 is ""Have client assess current state of his/her health and/or wellbeing."" The primary purpose from a coaching perspective is to foster client self-awareness and insight (C), which is the foundation for creating a vision and setting goals. Option A puts the coach in the expert/director role. Option B is a secondary benefit but not the primary purpose. Option D is a possibility but not the primary coaching function.",2
1006,Coaching Structure,1.3.2,Application,"A coach asks a client, ""Imagine it's a year from now and you are living your healthiest, most vibrant life. What does that look like? What are you doing, thinking, and feeling?"" This question is primarily designed to:","Set a long-term, measurable goal.",Explore the client's vision of optimal health.,Assess the client's readiness for change.,Identify the client's main barriers.,B,"This is a classic visioning question, directly aligning with competency 1.3.2, ""Explore the client's vision of his/her optimal health and/or wellbeing."" It encourages the client to think expansively about their desired future before narrowing down to specific goals. While it may touch on elements of A, C, and D, its primary purpose is vision exploration.",2
1007,Coaching Structure,1.3.3,Application,"After a client describes their vision for optimal health, the coach says, ""Thank you for that vivid picture. Now, let's talk about where you are today. What feels like the biggest difference between the life you just described and the life you are living now?"" This question is designed to:",Develop discrepancy.,Identify gaps between the current and desired state.,Build self-efficacy.,Set a SMART goal.,B,"This question directly addresses competency 1.3.3, ""Identify gaps between current state and client's desired lifestyle/outcomes."" While it also helps develop discrepancy (a key MI concept), the most precise answer based on the NBHWC content outline is identifying the gap. This gap analysis is what motivates the desire for change.",2
1008,Coaching Structure,1.3.4,Application,"A client has several health concerns, including high blood pressure, poor sleep, and high stress. When choosing an initial area of focus, what is the coach's MOST important role?","To guide the client toward focusing on the high blood pressure, as it is the most serious clinical risk.",To empower the client to choose the area that feels most important or motivating to them at this time.,"To suggest starting with stress, as it likely impacts the other two areas.",To create a comprehensive plan that addresses all three issues simultaneously.,B,"This is a critical competency (1.3.4). The NBHWC framework emphasizes that the client, not the coach, determines the priority. Even if one area seems more clinically urgent (A), coaching success depends on the client's intrinsic motivation. Therefore, the coach's role is to facilitate the client's choice (B). Options C and D are directive and coach-centered.",2
1009,Coaching Structure,1.3.5,Application,"A client's vision is to ""be healthier."" How can a coach BEST help the client refine this into a long-term goal?","By asking, ""What does 'healthier' mean to you specifically?""",By suggesting they aim to lose 10% of their body weight.,By providing them with a list of common health goals to choose from.,"By telling them that ""being healthier"" is too vague to be a useful goal.",A,"Competency 1.3.5 involves establishing or refining long-term goals. The best approach is to use open-ended, clarifying questions (A) to help the client translate a vague desire into a more concrete concept that is meaningful to them. B and C are prescriptive, and D is critical rather than collaborative.",2
1010,Coaching Structure,1.3.6,Application,A client sets a long-term goal to run a 5K race. What is the BEST example of a short-term SMART goal to support this?,"""I will try to run more this week.""","""I will run three times this week for 20 minutes each time, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning.""","""I will become a better runner.""","""I will buy new running shoes and a fitness tracker by the end of the month.""",B,"This question tests the ability to establish SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals (Competency 1.3.6). Option B is the only one that meets all the criteria. A is not specific or measurable. C is not specific, measurable, or time-bound. D is a preparatory step but not a behavioral action goal.",2
1011,Coaching Structure,1.3.7,Application,"When supporting a client in creating an action plan, the coach asks, ""That's a great goal for the week. What might get in the way, and what's a possible backup plan if that happens?"" What is the primary purpose of this question?",To lower the client's confidence so they set a more realistic goal.,To create a contingency plan to increase the likelihood of success.,To focus the conversation on potential failure rather than success.,To test the client's commitment to the goal.,B,"Competency 1.3.7 explicitly includes supporting the client with ""back-up plans."" Proactively discussing potential barriers and creating contingency plans is a key strategy to build resilience and self-efficacy, making success more likely. It is not intended to lower confidence (A) or focus on failure (C).",2
1012,Coaching Structure,1.3.8,Application,"A coach asks a new client, ""As we work together, how will you know you're on track? And what's the best way for me to support you in staying accountable to the plans you make?"" This line of questioning primarily serves to:",Establish the coach's authority in the relationship.,Test the client's knowledge of coaching theory.,Determine the client's preferences for learning and accountability.,Set the fee structure for the coaching engagement.,C,"This directly addresses competency 1.3.8, ""Establish client's preferences for learning and maintaining accountability."" It is a collaborative process that honors the client's autonomy by asking them how they want to be supported, rather than the coach imposing a single method of accountability.",2
1013,Coaching Structure,1.2.1,Application,"During the initial session, what is the primary goal of explaining the coaching process to the client?",To demonstrate the coach's expertise and knowledge.,To ensure the client understands their role as the primary driver of the agenda and outcomes.,To justify the cost of the coaching services.,To complete the required paperwork as quickly as possible.,B,"Explaining the coaching process (JTA T-1) is crucial for setting expectations. The most important aspect is to clarify the roles, emphasizing that the client is autonomous and responsible for their own change journey. This prevents misunderstandings where the client expects the coach to be a director or expert who provides all the answers.",3
1014,Coaching Structure,1.1.1,Application,A coach is preparing for a session with a client who has consistently expressed feelings of being overwhelmed. Which action BEST demonstrates the coach's preparation to be emotionally available?,Researching advanced time management techniques to share with the client.,Setting a firm agenda for the session to ensure it stays on track.,Engaging in a 5-minute mindfulness practice to clear their own mind of distractions.,Preparing a list of questions to challenge the client's perspective on being overwhelmed.,C,"Competency 1.1.1 emphasizes the coach being ""calm, present, and emotionally available."" The coach's own state is paramount. Engaging in a mindfulness practice (C) directly addresses the coach's internal state, allowing them to be more present and less reactive, which creates a safe space for the overwhelmed client. A, B, and D are all coach-centered actions that may not meet the client's needs.",2
1015,Coaching Structure,1.3.2,Knowledge,What is the primary reason for exploring a client's values during the early stages of a coaching relationship?,To judge whether the client's values align with the coach's.,To use as a foundation for uncovering intrinsic motivation for change.,To create a formal list to include in the coaching contract.,To determine if the client is a good fit for coaching.,B,"Exploring values is a key part of exploring a client's vision (Competency 1.3.2). The purpose is to connect proposed behavior changes to what is deeply important to the client.

A is not specific and may not be achievable. B is a task, not a behavior change. D is a feeling, not a measurable action.",2

The client replies, ""A 5."" What is the coach's BEST next step?",Encourage the client to try harder to increase their confidence.,Accept the goal as is and check in next week.,"Ask, ""What would need to change to make that a 7 or an 8?""",Suggest a completely different goal that the client might be more confident about.,C,"This question directly supports competency 1.3.8 by collaboratively adjusting the plan to increase self-efficacy. Asking what would raise the score (C) invites the client to problem-solve and modify the action step to make it more achievable, thereby increasing their confidence and likelihood of success. A is unhelpful pressure. B sets the client up for potential failure. D abandons the client's original goal too quickly.",7

Let's try to focus on something positive to turn things around.""","""Tell me more about what made the week feel rough.""","""Everyone has rough weeks. What was your goal from our last session?""","""I understand. My week was pretty tough, too.""",B,"Competency 1.3.2.1 is ""Establish rapport; connect with client by helping them feel seen and heard."" Option B is an open-ended invitation for the client to share their experience, showing the coach is present and listening. A dismisses the client's feelings. C ignores the client's opening and pushes the coach's agenda. D shifts the focus to the coach.",6
2002,Coaching Process,1.2.3,Application,"A client states, ""I know I should quit smoking, but I just don't think I can. I've tried and failed so many times."" The coach replies, ""You're feeling discouraged because of past attempts, yet you're still here talking about it, which shows incredible persistence."" This response is an example of:",Giving advice.,A closed-ended question.,Reframing and affirmation.,A simple reflection.,C,"This response reframes the client's ""failure"" as ""persistence"" (a strength) and affirms their effort, which supports self-efficacy. This aligns with competencies 1.2.3 (refrain from directing) and the principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Positive Psychology. It is not advice (A), a question (B), or just a simple reflection (D).",8
2003,Coaching Process,1.2.2.4,Application,"During a session, a coach who is financially well-off is working with a client struggling with food insecurity. The coach finds themselves thinking, ""If they just budgeted better, they could afford healthier food."" This thought is an example of:",Empathy.,A potential personal bias and judgment.,Appreciative Inquiry.,A perceptive reflection.,B,"Competency 1.2.2.4 requires a coach to be ""aware of own social identities, power, privileges, unconscious bias, and personal triggers."" The coach's thought is a judgment stemming from their own privileged perspective and fails to consider the systemic factors of food insecurity. Recognizing this thought as a bias is the first step in managing it and not letting it harm the coaching relationship.",6
2004,Coaching Process,1.3.2.7,Application,"A coach, intending to be encouraging, says to a client from a different cultural background, ""You speak English so well!"" The client seems to withdraw after the comment.

The comment, while well-intentioned, is a common microaggression that implies the client is a perpetual foreigner. The best response is to take responsibility, apologize sincerely, and open a dialogue (B), which demonstrates cultural humility. A and D avoid responsibility, and C is defensive.",6

What's your plan for this week?""",C,"This is a complex reflection that captures both the content (exercised, ate pizza) and the underlying emotion (frustration, disappointment). It demonstrates deep listening (S-7) and empathy (S-4) without judging, advising, or asking a ""why"" question that can sound accusatory. A is reassurance. B is a ""why"" question. D moves to planning too quickly.",3
2006,Coaching Process,K-3,Application,"A coach asks, ""What are the good things about your current eating habits, and what are the not-so-good things?""
